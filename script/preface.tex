This document contains my work in regard to the magnetospin effect, first discribed by Dr. Elena Vedmedenko, who proprosed this topic to me, and Tim Matthies, who already conducted fundational investigations. My goal is to derive an accurate mathematical description of this effect, leading to accurate computational simulations of the discribed systems.
