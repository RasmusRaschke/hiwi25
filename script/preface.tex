This document contains our work regarding the novel spin revolution effect, first described by PD Dr. Elena Vedmedenko and Prof. Roland Wiesendanger\cite{Vedmedenko}. The goal of this project is to further the understanding of the presented systems by investigating certain mathematical aspects of the system's description. Our hope is to procure either analytically solvable equations of motions or prove that such solutions do, in fact, not exist. We start by introducing the necessary mathematical principles rooted in the theory of manifolds, variational calculus and ordinary differential equations. From there on, we investigate various realizations of the spin revolution effect.
